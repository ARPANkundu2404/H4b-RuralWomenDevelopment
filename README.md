## 🧭 Project Workflow

### 🚀 How it Works (Admin Perspective):

1. **🔐 Authentication & Access Control**
   - Only users with the **admin role** can access this panel.
   - Admins are redirected if they attempt unauthorized access.

2. **📦 Product Approval System**
   - Admins can view all products pending approval.
   - Options to ✅ *Approve* or ❌ *Reject* a product.
   - Upon approval/rejection, the respective seller receives an **email notification** 📩.

3. **⭐ Feature Management**
   - Approved products can be marked as **Featured**.
   - Featured products receive special attention on the marketplace 🎉.

4. **📊 Transactions Overview**
   - Admins can also view a list of transactions for transparency and analysis.

5. **🔔 Notification System**
   - Real-time notifications inform the admin of actions taken (like approval or rejection).
